TEST:
- pups saved moving between regions?
- game no longer crashes if placing a pup in a shelter the player is not in
- persistent pups are different across campaigns
- pups that respawn in rooms just outside shelters actually spawn?
- unique settings such as chance and min/max are properly loaded in different campaigns
- FP refuses spawns in all campaigns
- moon refuses spawn in spearmaster campaign

- add Inv options

DEBUGGING:
- ISSUE: Pups respawn in test region but are impossible to find--likely level-editing related error, investigate

Optional:
- persistent pups that spawn tamed begin the cycle *actually* tamed
    - Player HUD: need to add pup food bar & associate it with correct pup
    - pup FriendTracker: add appropriate player
    - ???
    - profit
    - dis gonna be hard
- simulate hibernation; pups that do not find enough food will die,
    pups that survive have their food decreased next cycle.
    If player hibernates with less than 3/4 cycle time remaining, randomly determine which pups get enough food
    - edits to PupAI will be needed to make feasible
- compatibility with PupKarma (pups killed by the player will not return to life)
    - untamed pups that die of natural causes return with lowered karma value?
- mod support for Outsider mothpups & Beecat bups
- further modpup support
- options menu automatically creates toggles for dependent mods??
    
    
DONE:

- Spawn pups randomly on cycle start
    - Detect rooms with den nodes
    - Give rooms different spawn weights according to number of dens
    - Randomly select number of new pups
    - Randomly select room by weight for each new pup
    - Place new pup in room
- Reload pups that have survived on next cycle
    - Locate all pups in region which are not in shelters
    - If alive, retrieve pup ID and current room -TODO: double check this works as intended (i.e pup carcasses aren't saved)
    - Save ID and room to save data with correlation to each other
    - Retrieve ID and room from data
    - Respawn saved pups, subtracting from random number of new pups each time
- Gaussian random selection for number of pups each cycle
- Retrieve customizations for mod characters & regions from .txt files
    - Campaign specfic min/max pups per cycle
    - Region specific min/max pups per cycle
    - Forbidden regions/campaigns
- Pup carcasses will no longer respawn as living pups
- Campaign settings can specify whether or not dynamic pups spawn, the min and max amount, and spawn chance
- Campaigns that normally cannot spawn pups don't spawn dynamic pups either
- Settings for official slugcat campaigns
